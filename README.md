### Summary

The Liberty App Accelerator provides a starting point for creating applications running on [WebSphere Liberty](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/).

To deploy this application to IBM Cloud using a toolchain click the **Create Toolchain** button.
[![Create Toolchain](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/devops/graphics/create_toolchain_button.png)](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/devops/setup/deploy/)

### Requirements
* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install)
* Java 8: Any compliant JVM should work.
  * [Java 8 JDK from Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
  * [Java 8 JDK from IBM (AIX, Linux, z/OS, IBM i)](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/),
    or [Download a Liberty server package](https://developer.ibm.com/assets/wasdev/#filter/assetTypeFilters=PRODUCT)
    that contains the IBM JDK (Windows, Linux)

### Configuration
The application is configured to provide various technologies and features. These capabilities are provided through dependencies in the build.gradle file and Liberty features enabled in the server config file found in `src/main/liberty/config/server.xml`.

### Project contents
The context root is set in the `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/ibm-web-ext.xml` file. The ports are set in the build.gradle file. 

* **MicroProfile** : The [MicroProfile project](http://microprofile.io/) is an open community with the aim of optimizing Enterprise Java for a microservices architecture.  MicroProfile will be evolving with guidance from the community. For the complete feature documentation, see the [microProfile-1.2](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEQTP_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.nd.multiplatform.doc/ae/rwlp_feature_microProfile-1.2.html) feature description in IBM Knowledge Center. If you want to share your thoughts you can post straight to the [MicroProfile Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/microprofile). 

* **Persistence** : For the complete feature documentation, see the [jpa-2.1](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEQTP_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.nd.multiplatform.doc/ae/rwlp_feature_jpa-2.1.html) feature description in IBM Knowledge Center. 

* **REST** : Inside the project there is a application.rest package containing the `LibertyRestEndpoint` class. This adds a REST endpoint which you can access at `http://localhost:9080/<context>/rest`. There is also a test class named `it.rest.LibertyRestEndpointTest` that will test the REST endpoint to ensure it is working. For the complete feature documentation, see the [jaxrs-2.0](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEQTP_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.nd.multiplatform.doc/ae/rwlp_feature_jaxrs-2.0.html) feature description in IBM Knowledge Center.   

* **Swagger** : Swagger is a simple yet powerful representation of RESTful APIs. Discover REST APIs that are available on the Liberty server and then invoke the found REST endpoints using the Swagger user interface. (Username and password are specified in the server.xml). You can also easily expose the REST endpoints available from your web modules running on Liberty server by documenting the endpoints using the Swagger 2.0 Specification. It is also possible to follow a design-first approach by creating the Swagger documentation first and then generating the server code from it. For the complete feature documentation, see the [apiDiscovery-1.0](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEQTP_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.nd.multiplatform.doc/ae/rwlp_feature_apiDiscovery-1.0.html) feature description in IBM Knowledge Center.    

The project contains IBM Cloud specific files that are used to deploy the application as part of an IBM Cloud DevOps flow. The `.bluemix` directory contains files used to define the IBM Cloud toolchain and pipeline for your application. The `manifest.yml` file specifies the name of your application in IBM Cloud, the timeout value during deployment and which services to bind to.

### Run

To build and run the application:
1. `gradle build`
1. `gradle libertyStart`
1. To stop the application run `gradle libertyStop` 

To deploy the application to IBM Cloud:
1. `gradle build cfPush -PcfOrg=[your email address] -PcfUsername=[your username] -PcfPassword=[your password]`

The application will be deployed to the following url: [http://LibertyProject.mybluemix.net/LibertyProject/]

Alternatively use the Toolchain button above.

### Endpoints

The context root is set in the `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/ibm-web-ext.xml` file. The ports are set in the build.gradle file.
